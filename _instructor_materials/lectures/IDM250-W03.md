## Week 3 - Agenda
- Dyanmic Headers + Footers

## Wordpress Basic Templates
- style.css

^ At the very minimum, a WordPress Theme consists of two files: 

---
## Wordpress Typical Templates 
- header.php
- footer.php
- sidebar.php
- comments.php
- comments-popup.php

^ Using these template files you can put template tags within the index.php master file to include these other files where you want them to appear in the final generated page.

- To include the header, use `get_header()`.
