## Grading Policy
Grading is based upon attendance, class participation, homework assignments and progression in the medium.

Students who are on their laptops or cellphones during class critiques will lose points on their own assignments.

### Homework Assignments
- 1 day late = -10%
- 2 days late = automatic zero
- 2nd late in the semester = -20%
- 3nd automatic zero

### Midterm/Final
- 1 day late = -15%
- 2 days late = automatic zero

## Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to attend all classes and strictly adhere to the project due dates. Lack of participation in class discussions will count against your grade.

Students are allowed one unexcused absence. If a student has more than one unexcused absence, his or her grade for the course will be reduced one letter grade. If a student has three absences, he or she will not get credit for the course.

Note that an excused absence is defined as one that is the result of a condition or circumstance beyond the student’s control, such as illness, a family crisis or emergency, or some other serious and important personal circumstance. An absence will be excused only if there is documentation verifying the circumstances that caused the absence.

One total point will be removed every time a student arrives late to class. If a student is more than 15 minutes late, they will be considered absent. 

The dates your assignments are due are indicated clearly in this course outline. Assignments are due on those dates unless you have submitted a written request for an extension at least ONE class before the assignment is due. Late assignments lose 50%. After 1 week, late assignments will no longer be accepted and will result in a zero.
